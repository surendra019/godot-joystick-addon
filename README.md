## Features

## Installation

1. Download a desired version from the releases section and paste the ```Virtual Joystick``` folder in the ```res://addons/``` directory in your project.
2. Enable the plugin from the ```Project settings > Plugins```.
3. Add a ```VirtualJoystick``` node in your controller scene.
4. Set the position and use it.

## Getting the Direction
- Use the get_direction() function to get the current direction of the joystick. The returned value is a normalized Vector2 representing the joystick's direction.

```
func _process(delta):
    var direction = $VirtualJoystick.get_direction()
    if direction != Vector2.ZERO:
        move_and_slide(direction * SPEED)
```
